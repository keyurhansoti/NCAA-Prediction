## Overview 
   
* The Project aims to predict basketball game outcomes using data analysis tools such Hadoop, BigQyery, PySpark.        
* The interested audience are people who are into batting, game predictions as well as teams who can prepare themselves 
  against the predicted winner teams.

## Data 

* The Kaggle dataset "NCAA Basketball‚Äù will be used which is provided by the kaggle.     
* The data set contains data about NCAA Basketball games, teams and players. Thw game data convers play-by-play-by
  and box scores back to 2009, as well as final scores back to 1996. Additional data contains wins and losses goes back
  to 1894-5 season in some teams cases.
* For this project, We are choosing mens basketball games from the 2014-14 season to the 2017-18 season.
* The data set contains 132 features like game_id, season, status, coverage etc.
* The size of the whole data set is around 4 GB.

* For the preprocessing, we might need to remove some columns.

## Analysis

* First step is to understand the domain, dataset and algorithms to be implemented.
* Based on the analysis we will be creating a dashboard based on various user groups.
* We are planning to build prediction model using Biguery and create a dashboard based on it again.
* Dashboard will be hosted on Datastudio of Google Cloud Platform.
